and CLI operations options
Network modules
Cisco Catalyst 9200 Series switches come with modular or fixed uplinks as indicated in Table 
1
With modular SKUs, the field-replaceable network modules provide infrastructure investment protection by allowing a nondisruptive migration from 1G to 10G and beyond.
When you purchase the switch, you can choose from the network modules described in Table 
3
For additional details, please read our FAQ: https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/switches/catalyst-9000/nb-09-cat-9k-faq-cteen.pdf.
Platform resiliency
Power supplies
Cisco Catalyst 9200 Series switches support dual field-replaceable power supplies (Figure 
3
Each switch ships with one default power supply, and a second identical power supply can be purchased with the initial order or can be added later.
The second power supply can provide redundancy or additional power to PoE+ ports as needed.
Cisco Catalyst 9200CX Series HVDC models can be powered by high voltage DC as well as line voltage AC with its default power supply.
These switches support high efficiency and low energy consumption when connected to DC micro grid by avoiding multiple AC-DC conversions.
The compatibility with AC also provides flexibility and investment protection for moving to DC power in the future.
• IEEE 802.3bt
Class 6 and Cisco UPOE (up to 60W per port) is supported on Catalyst 9200CX Series mGig model.
This facilitates delivery of network power to devices requiring higher power.
Intelligent PoE+
• PoE Powered Device (PD) -Catalyst 9200CX-12T-2X2G can be powered through the uplink with IEEE 802.3bt class 6 or UPOE+ power from upstream switch.
• Perpetual PoE is supported on Cisco Catalyst 9200 Series switches, and maintains the PoE+ power during a switch reload.
This is important for critical endpoints such as medical devices and for Internet of Things (IoT) endpoints such as PoE-powered lights, so that there is no disruption during a switch reboot.
• Fast PoE: When power is restored to a switch, Fast PoE starts delivering pow er to endpoints without waiting for the operating system to fully load, thereby speeding up the time for the endpoint to start up .

Cisco provides turnkey solutions such as Plug and Play and Preboot Execution Environment (PXE) that enable an effortless and automated deployment.
Performance and scalability
Performance specifications
• API-driven configuration is available with modern network switches such as Cisco Catalyst 9200 Series switches.
It supports a wide range of automation features and provides robust open APIs over NETCONF and RESTCONF using YANG data models for external tools, both off the shelf and custom built, to automatically provision network resources.
• Granular visibility enables model-driven telemetry to stream data from a switch to a destination.
The data to be streamed is identified through subscription to a data set in a YANG model.
The subscribed data set is streamed to the destination at specified intervals.
Additionally, Cisco IOS XE enables the push model.
It provides near-real-time monitoring of the network, leading to quick detection and rectification of failures.
Cloud monitoring for Catalyst is also available.
• Seamless software upgrades and patching supports OS resilience.
On Cisco Catalyst 9200 Series switches Cisco IOS XE supports cold patching with reboot, which provides fixes for critical bugs and security vulnerabilities between regular maintenance releases.
This support lets you add patches without having to wait for the next maintenance release.
Cold patching requires the switch to be rebooted after patching to allow the changes to take effect.
• Trustworthy solutions built with Cisco Trust Anchor Technologies provide a highly secure foundation for Cisco products.
With Cisco Catalyst 9200 Series switches, these technologies enable hardware and software authenticity assurance for supply chain trust and strong mitigation against man-in-the-middle attacks that compromise software and firmware.
Trust Anchor capabilities include image signing, Secure Boot, and Cisco Trust Anchor module.
• High availability: Cisco Catalyst 9200 Series switches support high-availability features, including the following:
• Cross-stack EtherChannel provides the ability to configure Cisco EtherChannel technology across different members of the stack for high resiliency.
• IEEE 802.1s
Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP) provides rapid spanning tree convergence independent of spanning tree timers and also offers the benefit of Layer 2 load balancing and distributed processing.
• Per-VLAN Rapid Spanning Tree (PVRST+) allows rapid spanning tree (IEEE 802.1w) reconvergence on a per-VLAN spanning tree basis, providing simpler configuration than MSTP.
In both MSTP and PVRST+ modes, stacked units behave as a single spanning tree node.
• Switch-port auto-recovery ("err-disable" recovery) automatically attempts to reactivate a link that is disabled because of a network error.
• The Catalyst 9200 Series platform delivers the best SSO resiliency architecture in a stackable solution with sub-50-ms failover.

Licensing
Introduction to Smart Licensing
Cisco Smart Licensing is a flexible licensing model that provides you with an easier, faster, and more consistent way to purchase and manage software across the Cisco portfolio and across your organization.
And it's secure -you control what users can access.
With Smart Licensing you get:
• Easy Activation: Smart Licensing establishes a pool of software licenses that can be used across the entire organization-no more PAKs (Product Activation Keys).
• Unified Management: My Cisco Entitlements (MCE) provides a complete view into all of your Cisco products and services in an easy-to-use portal, so you always know what you have and what you are using.
• License Flexibility: Your software is not node-locked to your hardware, so you can easily use, and transfer licenses as needed.
To use Smart Licensing, you must first set up a Smart Account on Cisco Software Central (software.cisco.com).
For a more detailed overview on Cisco Licensing, go to cisco.com/go/licensingguide
Software licenses
Managing licenses with Smart Accounts
Creating Smart Accounts by using the Cisco Smart Software Manager (Cisco SSM) enables you to order devices and licensing packages and also manage your software licenses from a centralized website.
You can set up Cisco SSM to receive daily email alerts and to be notified of expiring add-on licenses that you want to renew.
You must order an add-on license in order to purchase a switch.
When the license term expires, you can either renew the add-on license to continue using it or deactivate the add-on license and then reload the switch to continue operating with the base license capabilities.
Both the base and add-on licenses are also available for a 90-day evaluation period.
An evaluation license is activated temporarily, without purchase.
An expired evaluation license cannot be reactivated after reload.
Note: It is not required to deploy Cisco Catalyst Center, just to use one of the above packages.

Software Platform software benefits Cisco IOS XE Cisco
IOS XE Software opens a completely new paradigm in network configuration, operation, and monitoring through network automation.
Cisco's automation solution is open, standards-based, and extensible across the entire lifecycle of a network device.
The various automation mechanisms are outlined below.
IP unicast routing protocols (including static, Routing Information Protocol Version 1 [RIPv1], RIPv2, RIPng, and Open Shortest Path First [OSPF], Routed Access) are supported fo r small network routing applications with the Network Essentials stack.
Equal-cost routing facilitates Layer 3 load balancing and redundancy across the stack.
• Advanced IP unicast routing protocols (including Full [OSPF], Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing
Protocol [EIGRP], and Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System Version 4 [IS-ISv4]) are supported
for load balancing and for constructing scalable LANs. Ipv6 routing (using OSPFv3 and EIGRPv6) is
supported in hardware for maximum performance.
